# The Pet Ranch

This application both has [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This web application intended to view, order or donate rescue animals. Due to the local location of the rescue house, we created this app to serve a wider range of customers.

### File Structure 

There are two files which will serve as the app and api

### `./api`

In this directory will be everything for the api server

### `./app`

In this directory will be everything for the app server

### Node Packages

### `npm install`

In both ./app and ./api files must input `npm install`into the terminal to install the npm files for the application.

### Running the App

### `npm run start`

Command which runs the application in dev mode
In the terminal open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Command which also runs the api node server
In the terminal open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in your browser.

Note! Both servers will need to run at the same time, otherwise the application won't work as intended.

## Future Developments and Deployment

In the future this project will have both application and api server on a AWS EC2 cloud service, to serve it to the internet.

Assets will be properly licensed before deployment or any commerical uses.
